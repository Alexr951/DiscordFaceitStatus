# Faceit API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://developers.faceit.com/
#
# NOTE: The FACEIT Data API key is general-purpose and NOT tied to any specific user.
# You can use the same API key to track ANY public FACEIT user's matches.
# The API key is only used for authentication, not for restricting which players
# can be tracked.

# FACEIT nickname to track (case-sensitive)
#
# IMPORTANT: This can be ANY public FACEIT user's nickname - not just your own!
# The API key does NOT need to belong to this user. You can track:
# - Your own matches
# - A friend's matches
# - Any pro player's matches
# - Any public FACEIT user
#
# Just enter their exact FACEIT nickname (case-sensitive).
